# Terms

These are terms from psychology, and the Cognitive Atlas and Neurosynth lesson
that might be useful to know.

## Cognitive Atlas

These are kinds of entities in the Cognitive Atlas.

 - **concept** is an idea in cognitive psychology that is represented as an entity in the Cognitive Atlas
 - **task** is a behavioral paradigm or activity used to measure one or more concepts. It could be an activity you do in the scanner, or filling out a questionnaire on paper.
 - **phenotype** is a general descriptor for an individual, encompassing disorders, personality traits, and behaviors.

## Neurosynth

 - **meta-analysis** is a statistical approach to combine the results of several studies. Traditionally, you might have to read say, 100 papers. With a tool like neurosynth, you can use an analytical method to (more more easily) do the same, and produce a statistical brain map to summarize what you find.
