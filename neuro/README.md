# NeuroSynth and Cognitive Atlas

This dinosaur lesson will cover a high level introduction to NeuroSynth and the
Cognitive Atlas. The lesson content and associated practice exercises (via jupyter
notebooks) are provided.

## What will I learn today?

 1. What are these tools?
 2. Why would I want to use them?
 3. How do I get started learning?

## Content

 - [Video Lesson](https://youtu.be/c07MYFA5xPU) This is the current video lesson (YouTube). Make sure to watch in HD
 - [Notebook Lesson](notebook/cognitive-atlas-intro.ipynb) A quick walk through of using the cognitiveatlas api.

# Development of Lesson

This is a documented development of the content.

## Logistics

 - This is a high level overview (with a little detail about "behind the scenes")
 - 30-45 minutes (15 minutes each?) 

## Original Transcript

So welcome to graduate school! Your fresly minted out of undergrad, you studied psychology and are ready to
study and write about amazing things about the human brain. Actually, you have a very particular interest,
and you come to Stanford and join the lab of Russ Poldrack.

Russ is a cognitive psychologist. Look him up on [wikipedia](). He studies what is going on in the brain during risk taking,
or general decision making

DEFINE cognitive psychologist: it means that he...

and he uses MRI, magnetic resonance imaging.

DEFINE Magnetic resonance imaging

And to give you a quick overview of MRI, there are actually two kinds. Anatomical and Functional, and they sound like what they are. Anatomical
is taking a static picture of your brain anatomy (so it's nice and detailed) and functional is picking up the brain activity, the BOLD signal thing.
The anatomical is used in analyses to help construct a map of your brain, meaning phsically where different structures are, and the
functional scan will tell us used to figure out where neurons are firing.

How? fMRI works with something called the BOLD signal (blood oxygen level dependent) signal that is picked up
by the MRI machine. In a nutshell, when you think, feel, or do just about anything, blood rushes to parts of your brain that are being used.
As they move away, (....)

In a nutshell, your advisor Russ takes pictures of the brain while doing different kinds of tasks that measure behavior
like decision making, and then does super advanced analyses to try to make connections between what you are doing
and what is going on in your brain. So as his graduate student, you will design a decision making study using fMRI. Let's get started!

So on your journey, my young graduate student, you are interested in asking if there is some difference between making choices
between food items, and some control like shapes. You must run a study! So you start out and recruit subjects to participate in your study. You put
them in the scanner, take an anatomical shot, then have them choose pictures of cakes or cookies as you record their
brain activity. You have blocks of choosing cakes or cookies, and blocks of choosing boring shapes. We won't go into study design,
but the shapes will be used as a base condition for contrasting with the cakes and cookies.

Before you even start, however, you need to do proper background research. You need to understand what we know about
the human brain and decision making. What do you do?

 - search google for brain and decision making
 - ask people walking around the psychology department
 - go to the library and find journal articles 

Geez, all of these things seem really hard. To start, you try out searching Google. That seems like a good idea. But then there is another problem!
You stumble on all these other terms that (maybe?) are related

RELATED TERMS

and then you feel lost in the wilderness of psychology terms, and are even farther away from your literature review than you started.
Never fear, my student! We have tools that are going to help you. Today we are going to talk about the Cognitive Atlas, and NeuroSynth

## Cognitive Atlas

 - do lesson to walk through doing search for term
 - find consolidated list (or some set) to look for
 - lead into neurosynth via "Search on Neurosynth"

## NeuroSynth

 - Start with a term
 - ask (and answer) what regions of the analysis are revealed for each term
 - How did neurosynth come about?
 - Briefly review what is going on with NeuroSynth

Finish with a little demo, and mention of notebooks provided in this repository!
